# Advanced_Split_Calculator

# Code Explanation:
The provided Python code is a simple program that helps you split a bill among a group of people and calculates how much each person owes or is owed based on an equal split. It calculates the total amount, average amount, and individual dues or repayments.

# Instructions:

1. Welcome Message:

The program starts by displaying a welcome message: "Welcome to Smart Split Calculator!".

2. Input Total Number of People:

You'll be prompted to enter the total number of people participating in splitting the bill.
Enter a numerical value representing the total number of people (e.g., 5).

3.Enter Individual Data:

The program will then prompt you to enter data for each person:
Name: Enter the name of the person (e.g., "Alice").
Amount: Enter the amount this person paid towards the bill (e.g., 50.75).

4. Calculations:

Once you've entered data for all individuals, the program calculates and displays the following:
Total amount paid by everyone: Displays the sum of all amounts entered.
Average amount per person: Displays the average amount by dividing the total amount by the number of people.

5.Individual Dues or Repayments:

For each person, the program calculates the difference between the amount they paid and the average amount.
It then prints a message indicating whether the person owes money, is owed money, or has no dues.
If the difference is zero, it means the person neither owes nor is owed anything.
If the difference is negative, the person owes money to the group.
If the difference is positive, the person is owed money by the group.

6.Repeat or Exit:

After displaying the individual dues/repayments, the program completes its execution.

# To Use the Code:

Run the code in a Python environment (e.g., IDLE, VS Code, Jupyter Notebook).

Follow the on-screen prompts:

Enter the total number of people splitting the bill.
For each person, enter their name and the amount they paid.
After entering data for all people, the program will display the total amount, average amount, and individual dues/repayments.

You can modify the code or use it as a basis to create more advanced split calculators or enhance its features if needed.
